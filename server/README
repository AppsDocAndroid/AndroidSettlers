This is just a bunch of junk I wrote while brainstorming...

The basic idea is that centralized online games could be served through a php
website.  Games would be coordinated by propagating a stream of actions to
all the clients.  It's a very simple idea, which could work well for simple 
games like this which are played on mobile devices that are unable to act as a
globally-accessible TCP/IP server.
