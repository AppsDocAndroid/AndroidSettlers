This is based off the "Island Settlers" code.  Android 1.6 or higher is required.

It is here for the academic interests of fellow developers :)

To build it, you need the Android API version 8 and either Ant or the ADT Eclipse plugin.


With the new graphics, some devices (such as the emulator) run out of memory while scaling textures.  It works fine on many phones though.  I use a Nexus One for testing.

Some support exists in the code for saving/loading games to sqlite, but it's a malfunctioning work-in-progress.
